# pan_usage
HTML5 version of Martin's heatmaps. One in Rack view, and the other in the same format as Martin's one.

www/heatmap.html (Rack View)
and www/heatmap4.html (Table View)

are the two actively used pages.

Martin's bin/heatmapjson.py and the derived bin/heatmapjson2.cgi are in this repo for reference, but the master copies are in Martin's repo.
